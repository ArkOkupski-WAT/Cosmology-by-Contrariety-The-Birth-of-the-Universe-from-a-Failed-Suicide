## About This Work

This repository presents a novel cosmological hypothesis that challenges conventional explanations for the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem. Instead of seeking symmetry-breaking mechanisms, we propose the **Principle of Contrariety** - a dynamic where the Universe's initial drive toward self-annihilation after the Big Bang accidentally leads to the complex cosmos we inhabit.

## Core Publications

### ðŸŽ¯ **Main Hypothesis**
**[The Birth of the Universe: A Physical Hypothesis Based on the Principle of Contrariety](https://github.com/ArkOkupski-WAT/Cosmology-by-Contrariety-The-Birth-of-the-Universe-from-a-Failed-Suicide/raw/main/The_Birth_of_the_Universe.pdf)**  
*The formal scientific presentation with mathematical framework, predictions, and detailed mechanism.*

### ðŸ“– **Philosophical Companion**  
**[A Tale of the First Contrariety: How the Universe, Wanting to Die, Accidentally Created Life](https://github.com/ArkOkupski-WAT/Cosmology-by-Contrariety-The-Birth-of-the-Universe-from-a-Failed-Suicide/raw/main/A_Tale_of_the_First_Contrariety.pdf)**  
*A narrative essay providing intuitive context and philosophical foundations for the main hypothesis.*

## Key Concepts

- **Principle of Contrariety (PC)**: The Universe's inherent drive to restore equilibrium through self-annihilation
- **SWS (Something Without Space)**: The primordial state emerging from the Big Bang
- **Great Segregation**: The cosmic process separating matter and quasi-antimatter
- **Quasi-Antimatter (qAn)**: A dispersed, non-structured form of antimatter responsible for cosmological effects
- **Stable vs Quasi States**: The crucial distinction explaining experimental null results

## Novel Predictions

- Antihydrogen falls identically to hydrogen in gravitational fields (ALPHA-g experiment)
- Quasi-antimatter, not stable antimatter, exhibits cosmological repulsion
- Structural segregation occurs at cosmic scales (~100 kpc)
- The observed Universe represents only the "successful" fraction of primordial fluctuations

## Supporting Materials

This hypothesis is supported by extensive analogical and conceptual work:
- Hydrodynamic analogies for matter-antimatter interactions
- Geometric models of spacetime "fasteners"
- Energy balance calculations
- Symmetry considerations in fundamental physics
